# PyCitySchools_Challenge
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to better understand how different schools compare to each other. The key indicators being compared are total budget, budget per pupil, and math and reading test scores. The comparison also breaks schools down by size (small, medium, large) and type (charter or public). In our version of the analysis, we will not include the math and reading scores from Thomas High School, due to suspected fraud. We will then compare the 2 analyses to see if there was any material change in the data and present the results to the board of education.
# Average Math Score
The average math score didn’t change, except for a minor fluctuation in the decimal places. The 9th grade test scores at Thomas High School were not outside of the normal range of test scores, therefore removing them had little effect on the data.

# Average Reading Score
Similar to the math scores at Thomas high school, removing the reading scores also had little effect on the data.

# Passing Math Percentage
Removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School who passed their math exams, dropped the passing percent of the district by ~ .6% (or 1 percentage point if rounded up)
Passing Reading Percentage
When we removed the Thomas High School 9th Graders who passed their reading exams, it lowered the district passing percentage by ~ .3%. 

# Overall Passing Percentage
Removing the Thomas High School 9th graders from the data, decreases the overall passing percentage of those who passed math and reading by a total of approximately  .8%. The exclusion of Thomas High School scores had very little effect on the data at the district level, as well as individual level. 

# Per Student Budget and Spending Ranges
The spending per student is mostly unchanged after removing the Thomas High students from the analysis. The students are still accounted for in the total school population and the district’s budget.

# Summary
When we removed the Thomas High School test scores for math and reading it had an insignificant effect on the results. Based on our analysis we are unable to conclude that there was a case of academic dishonesty with regards to the student’s math and reading scores at Thomas High School.
